Git Kata
=======
A repository for git katas. Each branch contains a specific problem that can be solved with git. You can use these exercises to improve your git skills by repeating them over and over.

Each kata contains three files: Two scripts, one for starting, one cleaning and a readme file explaining the problem.

Practive a kata
===============
To get started follow these two simple steps.

Contribute
==========
Create your own kata by duplicating an existing.

`git checkout --orphan kata_name_of_the_kata`

Then modify the scripts and readme file. Finally commit your changes. If you plan to use push or pull in your kata, it might be necessary with a tag on the first commit in the kata branch.
