You are working on 'master' very focused on your task. When you are done and want to commit, you realize that you have actually created more than one change.

Being the awesome developer that you are, you understand that each commit should only be one change.

The goal of this kata is to produce two commits, one for each change. 

The changes are:

1) One change for function A

2) A new, independent, function B.

Your target version tree looks something like this:

     A <---- B <---- C
     ^  
     |
